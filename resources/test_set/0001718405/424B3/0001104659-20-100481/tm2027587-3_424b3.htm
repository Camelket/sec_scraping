<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Since June 2016, Dr. Garrett, 60, was the
President and Chief Executive Officer of Nickel Creek Platinum Corp. (&#8220;NCP&#8221;), a mining exploration and development
company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the OTC-QB Market. She has more than 20 years of senior executive management experience
in the mining industry. Prior to joining NCP, she held the position of President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of
Romarco Minerals Inc. (&#8220;Romarco&#8221;) from November 2002 until October 2015, taking the multi-million-ounce Haile Gold
Mine from discovery through final feasibility, permitting and construction. Romarco was subsequently acquired by OceanaGold in
2015, at which time Dr. Garrett was appointed to the Board of OceanaGold and a member of the Steering Committee for the Haile Gold
Mine, before joining NCP in June 2016. Dr. Garrett is also a Director of NovaGold Resources, Inc., a gold company listed on the
NYSE American and Toronto Stock Exchange. Prior to Romarco, she held numerous senior positions in public mining companies including
VP of Corporate Development at Dayton Mining Corporation and VP of Corporate Development at Beartooth Platinum Corporation. Early
in her career, Dr. Garrett was the Senior Mining Analyst and Portfolio Manager in the precious metals sector with US Global Investors.
Dr. Garrett received her Ph.D. in Engineering and her Masters in Mineral Economics from the University of Texas at Austin. The
Board has determined that Dr. Garrett should serve as a director due to her technical expertise and background as a senior executive
in mining companies as well as her significant experience with permitting, developing and constructing gold mines and moving a
precious-metals mining company from the development stage to the successful producer stage. Dr. Garrett has also served as a director
of TriStar Gold, Inc. and Revival Gold Inc.</p>
