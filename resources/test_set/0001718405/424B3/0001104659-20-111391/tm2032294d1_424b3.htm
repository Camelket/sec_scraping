</font><i>Indemnification Procedures.</i> Any party that proposes to assert the right to be indemnified under this Section&#160;6
shall, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim is to be made
against an indemnifying party or parties under this Section&#160;6, notify each such indemnifying party of the commencement of
such action, enclosing a copy of all papers served, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve the
indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party under the foregoing provisions of this Section&#160;6
unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses by the indemnifying
party. If any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of its commencement,
the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it elects by delivering written notice to the
indemnified party promptly after receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the indemnified party, jointly with any
other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of the action, with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified
party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense, the indemnifying
party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses except as provided below and except for the reasonable
costs of investigation subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense. The indemnified party will
have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel will be at
the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing
by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal
defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying
party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified
party), (iii) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded that a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel
to the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall
not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (iv) the indemnifying party has
not in fact employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time
after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges
of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties. It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties
shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees,
disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time for all
such indemnified party or parties. All such fees, disbursements and other charges shall be reimbursed by the indemnifying party
promptly as they are incurred. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected without
its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). No indemnifying party shall, without the prior
written consent of each indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened
claim, action or proceeding relating to the matters contemplated by this Section&#160;6 (whether or not any indemnified party is
a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party
from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim, action or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to
or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and
expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section
6(a) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying
party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least
30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified
party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.</p>

</font><i>Contribution</i>. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification
provided for in the foregoing paragraphs of this Section&#160;6 is applicable in accordance with its terms but for any reason is
held to be unavailable from the Company or the Underwriters, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the total losses,
claims, liabilities, expenses and damages (including any investigative, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection
with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claim asserted, but after deducting any contribution
received by the Company from persons other than the Underwriters, such as persons who control the Company within the meaning of
the Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company, who also may be liable for
contribution) to which the Company and the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other. The relative benefits received by
the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds
from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions
received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. If, but only if, the
allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the allocation of contribution shall be made
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in the foregoing sentence but also the
relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions
which resulted in such loss, claim, liability, expense or damage, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations with respect to such offering. Such relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by
the Company or Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would
not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 6(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) which does not take into account
the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim,
liability, expense or damage, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 6(d) shall be deemed to include,
for purpose of this Section 6(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no Underwriter shall
be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions received by it, and no person found
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&#160;11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution
from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters&#8217; obligation to contribute as provided
in this Section 6(d) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. For purposes of this
Section 6(d), any person who controls a party to this Agreement within the meaning of the Act will have the same rights to contribution
as that party, and each director of the Company and each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement will have
the same rights to contribution as the Company, and each affiliate, director, officer, employee, counsel or agent of any Underwriter
will have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, subject in each case to the provisions hereof. Any party entitled
to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim
for contribution may be made under this Section 6(d), will notify any such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought,
but the omission so to notify will not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation
it or they may have under this Section 6(d). No party will be liable for contribution with respect to any action or claim settled
without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld).</p>
