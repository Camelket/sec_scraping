xbrl_parser and xbrl_structure:

	omitted the parsing of:
		-linkbases
		-concepts
		-imports and many more
	therefor not parsing an exact representation of the xbrl file.
	what would need to be changed to have a more exact representation:
		-parsing of the whole DTS: Taxonomy, Linkbases ect
		-classes: Arc, Locator, ExtendedLink, Concept, Taxonomy, Linkbase,
			  Scenario

		and removal or refactoring of: Tag, Segment
		
-addition of cache and downloader for the files not found locally while parsing:
	*those are mainly .xsd files imported in linkbases

filing_handler.py:
	changing XBRLFile to include all possible components found in a zip
	get rid of preprocessing_documents in its current form


addition of functions to handle the extraction of wanted data from parsed_filings
addition of proper docstrings everywhere

usable in its current form for XBRL from full-submissions.txt 10-Q/10-K us-gaap measures with some trial and error to find the wanted fields

	
	
amazing diagram that I wish I saw sooner:
https://github.com/manusimidt/py-xbrl/blob/main/docs/img/parser_class_diagram.png
	would be great repo if i had files from zip
	and needs query functionality added
	might use this repo instead of creating my own
